                {`When you are sitting at the poker table, mental energy is a precious resource. It is not reasonable to expect that you will observe and fully integrate every detail at the table. Part of improving as a poker player is learning to come to the table with greater reserves of mental energy, but far more importantly is the skill to conserve mental energy.

So how can we conserve mental energy without missing key information. For example, if we decided to tune out every 5th hand or get up from the table 5-10 minutes every hour, we risk missing key information. This isn’t to say that breaks aren’t important. I highly recommend taking at least some sort of break every hour and probably taking some sort of one hand mental break every half hour.

The key to conserving a resource is efficiency. Mental energy at the poker table is no different. The more usable poker info we can garner from the same amount of mental energy will lead to longer more profitable sessions.

What can we do to increase our efficiency of observation at the poker table? One, know what you are looking for. Two, know what to do with that information once you observe it. I have written articles on how to exploit common poker mistakes and how to quantify a read. Those articles address step two in greater detail. For the rest of this article, I am going to outline a checklist of what to look for in lower stakes games so you know how best to use your mental energy at the poker table.

Now quickly, a guide to using this checklist. These questions apply for each opponent in your game. It’s a good idea to use stereotypes and player-pool tendencies to a certain extent, but keep an eye out because people can surprise you if you aren’t looking closely. Sometimes the answer to these questions don’t have a clear implication. For example, if a player has multiple raise sizes preflop, that doesn’t necessarily tell you what those raise sizes mean. It is still worth observing so that you can try and then observe what those raise sizes mean now that you have discovered their existence. Not everything worth observing is on this checklist, so don’t let this become the be all end all of your poker observation. Finally, people can change, so be ready to reevaluate and always consider game circumstances when making your reads.
